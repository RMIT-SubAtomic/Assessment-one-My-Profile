        <p>
          I am an Australian born citizen with Argentinien family background, I left school halfway through year 12 to commence a
          traineeship as a Network Technician with a small local business on Yorke Peninsula, I then moved on from that role due to
          personal reasons and headed back into the hospitality game, there I was able to travel Australia and manage different hotels for a
          number of years. While traveling I had the opportunity to study a number of boating certificates to gain employment in the
          shipping trade, but that fell short, as I found my now beautiful wife who I have been with for 10 years and counting. One fun fact
          about me would be that I love cats, I have 5 cats at the moment 3 of them are stray kittens that I found in my electronics lab, I did
          not know what they where at first but after a long chase around my shed and lab I was able to catch them and slowly tame them to be
          these three beautiful kittens that they are now.

          <!-- Interest in IT Section -->
        <div>
          <h2 id="interest" class="w3-padding-5 w3-text-light-grey">Interest in IT</h2>
          <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
          <h4><b>What is your interest in I.T.?</b></h4>
          <p>
            My main interest in IT is with networks and security, I am fascinated with how the technology
            works from the hardware that connects everything to the software protocols that help establish
            how each computer talks to each other.
          </p>
          <h4><b>When did your interest in IT start? </b></h4>
          <p>
            At the age of 12, I built my first computer, it was an AMD K5 100mhz, it took me about 6 months
             buying the parts bit by bit, and from that moment on my interest in computers and IT started.
           </p>
          <h4><b>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?</b></h4>
          <p>
            I can remember getting my first computer book which was “Build your own PC, For Dummies” and
            it was like a bible for me, anytime I need help figuring out what to buy next for my computer
            I turned to that book if something was not working that is where I turned aswell.
          </p>
          <h4><b>Outline your IT experience (if any)</b></h4>
          <p>
            Up until about  3 months ago anything to do with computers or IT, in general, had been a
            21-year hobby, but I have finally taken the plunge and started my own business doing computer
            repair, web site design, data recovery, and network solutions.
          </p>
          <h4><b>Why did I choose to come to RMIT?</b></h4>
          <p>
            There are two major factors for me to choose RMIT, the first one being that I could study
            online giving me the convenience and flexibility to plan my study time around my personal life.
             The second reason is that I have three children and for myself to commence uni would mean that
             I would have to uproot my whole family and move 200 kilometers to Adelaide, and I do not think
              that is fair on them when I can study from my own home.
            </p>
          <h4><b>What do I expect to learn from my studies?</b></h4>
          <p>
            From my studies, I expect to learn a broad range of concepts in the technology field to start
             with and then from there I expect to be able to focus on a more specific field of study.
             I am aware that there will be some things that I already know, but I hope to be able to get a
             different perspective on those things and understand them in a different way. I also expect
             this course to be challenging and I am very excited to learn a whole lot of new skills.

                <h5><b>What do the results of these tests mean to you?</b></h5>
                <p>
                  I have interrupted my three personality tests as someone who is really thought
                  orientated, Observant, Imaginative, level headed, organized, and open to learning
                  new things and experiencing them. I can now understand a lot of my traits with a bit
                  more detail than before, for example, in the Education Planner test it explains that I
                  am a visual learner that I should sit up the front of the classroom therefore I can
                  really see what's going on, and I know in the past that is what I do. They also explain
                  that I am a logical and abstract thinker, I tend to agree with that as I love to think
                  about things from the perspective of how it works and what makes it work.
                </p>
                <h5><b>How do you think these test results may influence your behavior in a team?</b></h5>
                <p>
                  They point out that I can be a bit introverted so when working in large groups I
                  tend to fall to the back and work by myself, they also point out that I can be very
                  imaginative and level headed, I have always felt sub-par when it comes to ideas
                  so hearing that from a couple of different tests has made me realise that I should
                  not discredit myself so easily.
                </p>
                <h5><b>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</b></h5>
                <p>
                  Even though the results state that I am an Organized, systematic,
                  achievement-oriented planner I just need to be wary about turning into myself
                  that way I can stay active and vocal whilst working within a group. I really need to
                  take into account as well that I might feel a lot of pressure if I have a leadership
                  role, so if I do, I just need to take a step back and relax and remember that I have
                  a lot of good traits and the ability to succeed at whatever I am doing.

            <h4><b>Overview</b></h4>
            <p>
              This tool is a multi-purpose hardware vulnerability and hard drive backup/repair tool. It has the
              capability to repair hard drives with corrupt disks through bad sector reassignment and also
              force sector clipping/trimming[5], running diagnostic tools including full support for S.M.A.R.T
              checking system, disk imager for backup either to another disk or to an external flash drive,
              ability to reflash the hard drives firmware, run a virus scan on the drive, RAM diagnostic
              software. This unit also has an ethernet and wifi connection so the user can connect the device
              to an internet connection and have access to a massive database of firmware patches and
              install files, viruses and malware information to keep up to date with the latest threats. The user
              can use the device as a PXE to load operating System iso’s if your workstation or server if it can
              not boot from a USB or CD/DVD.
            </p>
            <h4><b>Motivation</b></h4>
            <p>
              With the sophistication of some of the current viruses and malware, threat detection and
              removal can become an extremely difficult task especially when it comes to a firmware virus on
              a user’s hard drive like EquationDrug or GrayFish [1]. The motivation in regards to the ability to
              scan a hard drive independently and then be able to back up and repair it, comes from the fact that
              I have always been looking for a single tool that incorporates those abilities, because you
              never know what can go wrong when reloading firmware or scanning a device and removing
              files, so having the ability to back up the drive with a complete image before doing any
              operations on it is great. The motivation for most of the features incorporated with this device
              comes from repairing computer disks and data recovery and the fact that there are so many
              different tools needed that having a single device that can work as a stand-alone unit would be great.
            </p>
            <h4><b>Description</b></h4>
            <h5>What's the interface going to be like?</h5>
            <p>
              This tool will be a stand alone unit, meaning you will not need access to the original computer to
              work with the drive that needs checking or backing up. At the moment the plans are to build this
              using a Raspberry Pi 4 b+ with a 7’ touch screen running Black Arch with all the tools needed
              pre loaded. To plug the hard drives in will be via USB 3. The interface will be easy to understand
              and well documented using programs that have a lot of support behind them and an active community.
            </p>
            <h5>How it will find infections?</h5>
            <p>
              This tool will connect to the internet through its on board ethernet port or through a wireless
              connection to access a database full of manufacturer firmware files as well as virus/malware
              repositories that will be stored on a server, It will then perform a full scan of either the disk itself
              or an image of that disk, checking every file for discrepancies or signatures that most virus /
              malware leave. It can then dump the firmware from the drives rom and reload it with a copy of
              the original firmware from the manufacturer.
            </p>
            <h5>How will it backup files?</h5>
            <p>
              There'll be a couple of options when it comes to backing up. First being a full disk image to an
              external source, making a temporary image to the device itself to be used to scan for infections
              quickly or using the network connection to copy the image to a server or a locally connected computer.
            </p>
            <h5>Future plans</h5>
            <p>
              Would like to see an extra ethernet port set on the device allowing traffic to pass through from
              one port to the next giving the user the ability to capture all the data that is flowing through their
              network. Also would like to see the device move away from using the raspberry pi and onto a
              custom PCB with own applications written in Assembly.
            </p>
            <h4><b>Tools and technologies</b></h4>
            <p>
              The base hardware will be a Raspberry Pi 4 with 4GB RAM [2], this is a small compact credit card computer that has specs of:

              To connect the hard drives to the Raspberry Pi will be through the USB to SATA cable or a USB
              3.0 SATA dock that can connect more than one drive. Running on the Raspberry Pi 4 b+ will be
              a Linux distro for Data recovery and system admin tasks called Black Arch, Black Arch comes
              with over 2300 tools [3] that can be used for data recovery, Disk backups, and imaging as well
              as setting up a server so a computer can use the Device as a PXE. This setup with the
              Raspberry Pi uses a 7” touchscreen monitor that will be incorporated into a custom 3d printed
              case giving it the ability to be used as a stand-alone unit and not need to access any system
              that might have been infected [4].

            <h4><b>Skills Required</b></h4>
            <p>
              I am targeting this device to computer professionals but I would like to be able to have the
              general home user be able to use it as well. There would be some basic skills needed in using
              the Linux terminal as well as connecting computer hardware but with a well-written help
              document, I am sure the home user could learn all the functions.
            </p>
            <h4><b>Outcome</b></h4>
            <p>
              If this project is successful it will cut down time used on threat detection / removal, complex disk
              repairs, data recovery, and firmware repairs. It will also turn what is normally an expensive
              endeavour into a cheap and viable option for anyone to implement. The ability to use a stand
              alone device for all of those actions will be very handy.
