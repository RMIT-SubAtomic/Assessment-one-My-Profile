        <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
        <p>I am an Australian born citizen with Argentinien family background, I left school halfway through year 12 to commence a traineeship as a Network Technician with a small local business on Yorke Peninsula, I then moved on from that role due to personal reasons and headed back into the hospitality game, there I was able to travel Australia and manage different hotels for a number of years. While traveling I had the opportunity to study a number of boating certificates to gain employment  in the shipping trade, but that fell short, as I found my now beautiful wife who I have been with for 10 years and counting.
        One fun fact about me would be that I love cats, I have 5 cats at the moment 3 of them are stray kittens that I found in my electronics lab, I did not know what they where at first but after a long chase around my shed and lab I was able to catch them and slowly tame them to be these three beautiful kittens that they are now.

        <div>
          <h2 id="interest" class="w3-padding-5 w3-text-light-grey">Interest in IT</h2>
          <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
          <h4><u>What is your interest in I.T.?</u></h4>
          <p>My main interest in IT is with networks and security, I am fascinated with how the technology
            works from the hardware that connects everything to the software protocols that help establish
            how each computer talks to each other.</p>
          <h4><u>When did your interest in IT start? </u></h4>
          <p>At the age of 12, I built my first computer, it was an AMD K5 100mhz, it took me about 6 months
             buying the parts bit by bit, and from that moment on my interest in computers and IT started.</p>
          <h4><u>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?</u></h4>
          <p>I can remember getting my first computer book which was “Build your own PC, For Dummies” and
            it was like a bible for me, anytime I need help figuring out what to buy next for my computer
            I turned to that book if something was not working that is where I turned aswell.</p>
          <h4><u>Outline your IT experience (if any)</u></h4>
          <p>Up until about  3 months ago anything to do with computers or IT, in general, had been a
            21-year hobby, but I have finally taken the plunge and started my own business doing computer
            repair, web site design, data recovery, and network solutions.</p>
          <h4><u>Why did I choose to come to RMIT?</u></h4>
          <p>There are two major factors for me to choose RMIT, the first one being that I could study
            online giving me the convenience and flexibility to plan my study time around my personal life.
             The second reason is that I have three children and for myself to commence uni would mean that
             I would have to uproot my whole family and move 200 kilometers to Adelaide, and I do not think
              that is fair on them when I can study from my own home.</p>
          <h4><u>What do I expect to learn from my studies?</u></h4>
          <p>From my studies, I expect to learn a broad range of concepts in the technology field to start
             with and then from there I expect to be able to focus on a more specific field of study.
             I am aware that there will be some things that I already know, but I hope to be able to get a
             different perspective on those things and understand them in a different way. I also expect
             this course to be challenging and I am very excited to learn a whole lot of new skills.</p>

          <img src="media/job-screenhot1.png" alt="Image of job from seek.com.au">
          <h4><u>Description</u></h4>
          <p class="w3-justify">I understand this job to be part of a small government body that needs
            a Cybersecurity specialist that is able to set up information management tools, provide risk
            assessment and be able to secure or penetrate networks. This position sticks out to me as it
            has everything that appeals to me in a job, from setting up networks and making sure they
            cant be breached using a range of Cisco software and hardware, then setting up email gateways
            and encryption with Symantec software, developing security programs for the government
            sounds extremely interesting too.</p>
            <h4><u>Skills Required</u></h4>
            <ul>
              <li>iso 2700/1 /2 /5 Certification</li>
              <li>Symantec E-mail gateway training</li>
              <li>Symantec encryption training</li>
              <li>Cisco Firepower NGFW training</li>
              <li>Cisco Stealthwatch training</li>
              <li>IT service Management training</li>
              <li>Working knowledge of security frameworks and methods</li>
              <li>Programing knowledge</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This job also requires you to have experience working in an IT environment and being able
              to implement ITSM processes.</p>
            <p>As I do not have any skills or qualifications required for this job at the moment I have briefly
              outlined how I am going to achieve them in the next paragraph.</p>
            <p>First I will complete my Bachelor in IT where I will focus my electives on networking and
               security, from there I will go on to doing a Masters in Cybersecurity at Uni SA for two years,
                after completing those two degrees I will then go onto getting my certification with CompTIA by
                passing the Server+, PenTest+ and CASP+ exams. After all my training I will look for employment
                in the IT security industry to give me practical experience for at least 5 years.
                Then I would look at applying for a position like the one I have listed as my ideal job.</P>
